Hi!
Welcome to my Honors thesis repository! Though I am still working on uploading several files, most of the raw data is present already as of 6/4/2025.
Here you should find the raw data of the Tax Farms taken directly from French chemist and tax-farmer Antoine Lavoisier's private journal used in the first chapter.
Additionally, you should find the models used in chapter 2 and 3 as well.
I included geospatial data on known guild locations from 16th to 19th century sourced from Sheilagh Ogilvie's Qualitative Guild Database 
Lastly, there is a guild simulation based on game theory payoff matrix between smuggling and abiding by guild orders to contextualize incentives and histroical occurences of smuggling within the guilds.

I am working on the project website and a fun little video to accompany the guild simulation. Will update - and better reorganize - as soon as I can.
